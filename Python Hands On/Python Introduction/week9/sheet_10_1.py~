''' 1. POS-Tagged text (3 Points)

On the course homepage, you can find a small example file containing
POS-tagged text, where words are represented as follows:

    <W TYPE="part of speech" ...>word</W>

Write a program that reads the file and outputs just the word
together with its POS (see example below).

Example:

python3 sheet_10_1.py sheet_10_1_example.txt

should print:

FACTSHEET NN1
WHAT DTQ
IS VBZ
AIDS NN1
...
